# MEET-IO
## Description

This application was created for our bootcamp's second project. This will showcase our acquired skills and knowledge to build a web application from scratch. Our focus is to execute a design that solves a real-world problem by creating a hub for groups of people to communicate.

This project was created using agile development methodologies and implementation of feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.
